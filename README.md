# organizefiles
This program is made to help me organize my school notes.  What this project does is listens for changes or modifications in a specified directory.  If a file is changed, and it contains a key specified in the dictionary named "mappings", then it moves the file to the value associated with the key.  This script is meant to run in the background at all times.
